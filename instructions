OPTIONAL PROJECT - ONLINE TIME TRACKER

This is an ungraded project for practice.  This is simply a chance to work independently to practice your web development skills.  

DESCRIPTION:
The application will be an online time tracker, which can be used by a company to have employees or contractors log their daily hours.  This data can then be used to both invoice clients as well as generate payroll.  All pages should be private.

REQUIREMENTS:

2. Full CRUD functionality for managing Clients (sample data can be entered)

3. Full CRUD functionality for managing Projects.  Each project must belong to a client (ie. there needs to be a Client dropdown on the add / edit Project page(s)).  Each project must also have a billing rate. (sample data can be entered)

4. Full CRUD functionality for managing Timesheets.  Each timesheet needs a date, client (dropdown), project (dropdown), project phase (dropdown - Planning, Design, Production, QA, Launch), description, and # of hours worked (decimal). (sample data can be entered)

5. Search timesheet capability by user, client, project, date, and keyword (from timesheet description).  Search Results grid should include: Sortable column headings and Export to Excel file functionality
